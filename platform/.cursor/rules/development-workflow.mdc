# Development Workflow

## Documentation Location

**Documentation files are located at `../../website/app/app/docs/content/`** (relative to the `platform/` directory). When asked to update or create documentation, edit or create files in that directory.

**Important**: When using tools that require absolute paths (like Read, Write, Edit), you must convert the relative path to an absolute path. Use `realpath ../../website/app/app/docs/content/` to get the absolute path, then use that with file operation tools.

## Starting Development

**Recommended**: Use Tilt for orchestrated development with hot reload
```bash
tilt up              # Start full development environment
```

**Alternative**: Manual workspace development
```bash
pnpm dev             # Start all workspaces in dev mode
```

## Before Committing

Always run these checks before committing code:

```bash
pnpm type-check      # Check TypeScript types across all workspaces
pnpm lint            # Lint and auto-fix with Biome
pnpm test            # Run tests (backend)
```

## Development Best Practices

1. **Use existing patterns** - Check neighboring files for examples before creating new patterns
2. **Follow project structure** - Keep test files colocated with source files
3. **Write tests** - Add `.test.ts` files alongside new models or utilities
4. **Use Tilt** - Prefer `tilt up` for the best development experience with hot reload
5. **Check Tilt UI** - Monitor logs at http://localhost:10350/ when using Tilt
6. **Database changes** - Always generate migrations with `pnpm db:migrate:dev`

## Common Commands Reference

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pnpm dev             # Start backend in watch mode
pnpm build           # Compile TypeScript to dist/
pnpm test            # Run tests with Vitest
pnpm db:migrate      # Run database migrations
pnpm db:studio       # Open Drizzle Studio
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev             # Start Next.js dev server with Turbopack
pnpm build           # Build for production
```

### Code Quality (from root)
```bash
pnpm type-check      # Check all TypeScript types
pnpm lint            # Run Biome linter
pnpm format          # Format code with Biome
```

## Debugging

- **Tilt Web UI**: http://localhost:10350/ - View logs and resource status
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000/ - Main application
- **Tools Inspector**: http://localhost:3000/tools - Inspect proxy requests
- **Drizzle Studio**: https://local.drizzle.studio/ - Database inspection
